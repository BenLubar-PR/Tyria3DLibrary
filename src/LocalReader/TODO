New Archive API (v2)

v1 was complete but couldn't satisfy the goals on performance side.
v2 changes:
  1. all scan functions are static (no definitions inside the iterator)
  2. the result lands in memory and are not dynamically pushed in the persistant storage
  3. result contains: [id] = {size, crc, fileType}
  4. during update/scan the content of the persistant storage automatically updates the archive meta array
  5. Remove all the previously added Promise since they block 1. so become irrelevant + Delete PromiseUtils
